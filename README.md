# Carbon-Emission-Predictor
I have taken a dataset from kaggle  of the cars which emits the carbon and Increases pollution So it is possible to predict the 
further carbon emission and we are also able to get the main cause of more carbon carbon emission .
Code  for prediction is possible using the scikit learn library for machine learning
Algorithms used are Linear regression and decision tree regressor
Random forest algorithim is not efficient for this type of predictions
